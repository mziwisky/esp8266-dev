esp8266-dev
===========

A Vagrant-powered virtual machine providing an isolated development
environment for the [ESP8266](https://github.com/esp8266/esp8266-wiki) $5
dollar "Internet of Things" WiFi module.


## What you'll need

1. A way to communicate with the chip's 3.3V TTL serial interface. I've had
   success with a [cable from Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/product/954)
   that's based on the PL2303 USB-to-TTL module.

2. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), a free open source virtualization
   package.

3. [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com), a virtualization management tool
   geared towards development environments.


## Let's Do This

0. Clone this repository.

1. If you'll be using a USB-to-TTL device like the Adafruit one I noted above,
   you'll need to edit the `Vagrantfile` to include your device's VendorId and
   ProductId. If you have the exact one I mentioned above, you may be fine with
   the existing configuration, but you may as well do this step too to be sure.
   It's an easy one.

   Connect your device to your computer and from the command line, run
   `VBoxManage list usbhost`. The output should be a list of entries that
   look like this:

        $ VBoxManage list usbhost
        Host USB Devices:
        ...
        UUID:               738b44fd-2f57-49dd-a16a-e31a0e7fa46f
        VendorId:           0x067b (067B)
        ProductId:          0x2303 (2303)
        Revision:           3.0 (0300)
        Port:               1
        USB version/speed:  0/1
        Manufacturer:       Prolific Technology Inc.
        Product:            USB-Serial Controller
        Address:            p=0x2303;v=0x067b;s=0x0002653c8cdc2c52;l=0x14100000
        Current State:      Captured

   Note the VendorId and ProductId. Set the `$vendor_id` and `$product_id`
   variables in `Vagrantfile` to those values. They must be strings of the
   hexadecimal representations.

2. In the console, run `vagrant up`. Note that this may take a decent chunk of
   time -- it was ~30 minutes on my 2013 Macbook Pro. Most of it is spent
   building the cross-compiler. Don't worry, it's a one-time cost.

3. That's it! Now you can `vagrant ssh` and start building your images!


## Sweet! ...now what?

Well, if you're brand new to Vagrant, skip down a couple of sections for a very brief primer, then come back.

Oh hi! Wecome back! Now, if I were you, first thing I'd do is make sure my
serial cable worked.  With it plugged in, `vagrant ssh` into the machine and
run `lsusb` to make sure it's in your list of devices. To see where it's
attached, run `dmesg` and somewhere near the bottom you should see something
like `usb 1-1: pl2303 converter now attached to ttyUSB0`. If not, you might try
unplugging it and plugging it back in, then running it again -- that way it'll
definitely be near the bottom of the log. If your device is attached anywhere
besides `/dev/ttyUSB0`, you'll need to adjust your scripts and Makefiles as
appropriate. No big deal.

`console.sh` is a tiny script to start a serial console on `/dev/ttyUSB0` at
115200 baud. Most ESPs seem to ship with their baud set to that. You may need
to change the device, of course, based on the output from `dmesg`. Now go ahead
and run that bad boy.

Plug your ESP8266 into your serial interface and tie its CH_PD and GPIO0 pins
HIGH. Pinouts, along with a ton of other info, can be found [on the esp8266
wiki](https://github.com/esp8266/esp8266-wiki/wiki/Hardware_versions). Now
power it on. You should see a bunch of garbage in your serial terminal,
followed by the word `READY`. Type `AS+RST` and hit Enter, and you should get
this back:

    AT+RST
    OK
    
    ets Jan  8 2013,rst cause:4, boot mode:(3,6)
    
    wdt reset
    load 0x40100000, len 24236, room 16
    tail 12
    chksum 0xb7
    ho 0 tail 12 room 4
    load 0x3ffe8000, len 3008, room 12
    tail 4
    chksum 0x2c
    load 0x3ffe8bc0, len 4816, room 4
    tail 12
    chksum 0x46
    csum 0x46
    
    ready

You're in business! Now the fun part -- you can either play around with [the AT
commands](http://www.electrodragon.com/w/Wi07c#AT_Commands), or kill the
console and go on to build...


## Sample project -- a fricken webserver

I've included a very awesome sample project from
[Sprite_tm](http://spritesmods.com/) -- an HTTP server dubbed
[esphttpd](http://www.esp8266.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=376). From inside the
virtual machine, `cd /vagrant/esphttpd && make` to build it. Then make sure
your chip is in firmware upload mode by tieing the CH_PD and GPIO2 pins HIGH
and the GPIO0 pin LOW. Power it on, and run `sudo make flash`, followed by
`sudo make htmlflash`. (The `sudo`s are needed to access /dev/ttyUSB0)

NOTE 1: you may receive `Failed to leave flash mode` exceptions after each
flash. Don't worry, it's most likely a false alarm.

NOTE 2: It's generally a good idea to power cycle the chip between uploads.
`sudo make flash` includes a `sleep 3` between two flashes to different
areas of memory, so you can use that delay to cycle.

For more info, see `esphttpd/README`.


## Vagrant tips, for the uninitiated

The project's root directory is mirrored to `/vagrant` on the virtual machine.

You can `sudo` from inside the machine without a password.

`vagrant ssh` - ssh into the machine

`vagrant halt` - shuts down the machine

`vagrant suspend` - puts the machine to sleep

`vagrant destroy` - removes every trace of the machine. NOTE: after a destroy,
the next `vagrant up` will have to reprovision the machine from scratch,
meaning it'll take a while.

`vagrant up` - spins up the machine, bringing it back up from `halt`,
`suspend`, or `destroy`


## ESP8266 Resources

- https://github.com/esp8266/esp8266-wiki - the wiki containing everything I
  needed to build this repo
- http://esp8266.com - a forum for people interested in hacking on the chip
- `#esp8266` on Freenode
- http://www.electrodragon.com/w/Wi07c - another nice wiki I found useful for
  exploring the AT commands


## A final note

esphttpd, along with all the other resources in this repo, was copied wholesale
from another place. In the case of esphttpd, that other place is [this git
repo](http://git.spritesserver.nl/esphttpd.git). I decided to do this rather
than make references to everything so that _this_ repo would remain a set of
tools that work together out of the box. I may change this practice in the
future.

*UPDATE:* it's the future, and @slaff has helped move toward not shoving
everything into this repo, so crosstool-NG is now pulled in by the
provisioning script. So is esptool.py. Thanks @slaff!
